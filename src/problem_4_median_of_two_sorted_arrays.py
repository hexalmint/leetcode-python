        Finds the median value of a sorted array, where that array is the
        combination of two sorted arrays and sorted is defined as smallest
        to largest.

        The algorithm's ultimate goal is to find the value at the median index
        (or indices when `m + n` is even, where `m` is the length of `nums1` and
        `n` is the length of `nums2`; a.k.a. the index of interest) of a combined
        and sorted array without combining and sorting the array.

        It starts by picking a median number of the array with the most amount of
        elements. This will reduce the longest array by a factor of ~2 on every
        iteration.

        For each number picked, the algorithm finds the index of that number in
        the combined and sorted array (using binary search under the hood).

        If the index found is less than the index of interest, the next iteration
        of the algorithm will only operate on the side of each list closer to the
        median index, dropping ~1/2 of the longer list and some amount of the
        shorter list.

        Once the index of interest is found during the index search, it's value
        is returned.
